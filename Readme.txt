This is python coding for a web-based filter application.

Some packages that must be installed:
1. PIL(Pillow)
2. Flask

To run the program (Windows only):
1. Open command prompt/cmd
2. cd to the project folder
3. Run the python file using the command "python (name of the file).py" (without double quotes).
4. If it has been run, just open the browser and type "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" (without double quotation marks)
5. Have fun :)
